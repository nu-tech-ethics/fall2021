Today's class will be virtual, on Zoom. <a href="https://richmondywong.com/" target="_blank">Richmond Wong</a> will be joining us. Richmond's research examines how technology professionals attend to and address ethical issues in their work. He also develops design-centered methods and approaches to identify ethical issues related to technology (particularly those surrounding social values such as privacy and security) with diverse stakeholders and users.
